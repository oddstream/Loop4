# Infinity Loop

Four-way version of the Android Infinity Loop game in Vanilla ES6 Javascript

Original concept by Infinity Games (Prof Dr Augusti Abreu from Portual).

The puzzle fills the available browser window. Click on a piece to rotate it 90&deg; clockwise (or hold down CTRL to rotate it anticlockwise). When the puzzle is completed,
the loops change colour and won't rotate any more. Refresh the browser window to create a new puzzle. Resize the browser window to make the puzzle easier or harder.
The idea is to make the game as simple and frictionless as possible; I've taken everything out that you don't really need. It's endless, so there's no concept
of levels or scores. Just relax and click.

It's implemented using a lattice of square-shaped linked nodes, which are called tiles. Each tile is an object which contains links to it's four neighbours.
So much more fun than using a two dimensional array.

Each tile is rendered inside its own HTML DIV element. The DIV element is a container for an SVG element, which contains an SVG group (G) and then SVG drawing element(s).
When the DIV receives a mouse click, the SVG group in the DIV is rotated 90&deg; in 15&deg; increments, timed against window.requestAnimationFrame(). Then the SVG is replaced with
a new copy.

The fifteen possible combinations of tile are precomputed and drawn in SVG, and saved in SYMBOL elements. When they are needed, they are referred to with SVG/HTML USE elements.

The loops are implemented not as loops, but by the notion of placing 'coins' at each edge of a tile that contains a link to it's neighbour. Each tile contains zero to
four coins. The coins are referred to by compass points. The coins are reciprocal, so, for example, if a tile has a 'north' coin, then it's neighbour to the north
will have a 'south' coin.

Each puzzle is random, created by placing coins randomly in each tile. A lot of fuss is taken to make the pattern symmetrical, by only seeding the top left corner 
of each puzzle, then copying and reflecting that pattern across the rest of the grid of tiles.

The puzzle is complete when, for each tile, every coin has a matching reciprocal coin in it's neighbour.

The coins for each tile are held as bits in a number. Tile rotation clockwise is done by rotating the bits in the number to the right.

The game is implemented in two files, a minimal wrapper .html file and a script .js file. All the exciting HTML is created on the fly by the script.

You can make the puzzle harder by lowering the value of the constant Q (the tile width/height in pixels) at the top of the .js file.
